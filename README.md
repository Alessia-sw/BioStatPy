# BioStatPy
< Useful calculations and statistics tools for biology students >
DISCLAIMER: This project is still a work in progress and still far from a complete product, with optimisation and fixing of certain tracebacks still needing to be done. Some of the functions offered by the program are incomplete. For the next version of the program I aim to eliminate some of these issues. 
<DOWNLOAD INFORMATION> To run the program in linux systems, just locate the path of the main file download and run it with python3. If you want to run the program with windows, you will need a code editing software such as Visual Studio Code. I am working on getting the program to run as a .exe to make download and running easier.
